## Important Points to be noted

> Making changes in the same file and pushing them will give rise to conflicts! (Huge pain in ...) <Br />
> So, Files like "Index.html" and "App.js" must not be changed by everyone!! Prefer adding them in your .gitignore seperately <Br />
> Please, (Please x100), do not push changes without announcing it on discord/whatsapp! <Br />
